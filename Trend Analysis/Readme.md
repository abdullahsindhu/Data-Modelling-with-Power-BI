# Trend Analysis in Power BI

This project leverages skills acquired through the "Trend Analysis in Power BI" course on DataCamp, focusing on analyzing time series data and uncovering trends. The project involves using Power BI to explore and visualize trends over time, identify key influences, and derive actionable insights.

## The Problem

The goal of this project is to analyze time series data to understand trends, seasonality, and significant influences on key metrics. This analysis aims to uncover hidden patterns and provide actionable insights for data-driven decision-making.

## Project Approach

The project is divided into four main steps:

### Step 1: Exploring Time Series Data

- **Objective**: Understand time-based variables and their transformations.
- **Activities**: 
  - Utilize Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to extract additional variables such as day of the week and time differences.
  - Build line charts to visualize metrics and identify trends.
  - Calculate period-over-period changes and rolling averages.

### Step 2: Analyzing Time Series in Power BI

- **Objective**: Deepen the analysis of time-based variables and metrics.
- **Activities**:
  - Build line charts in Power BI to further explore time-based data.
  - Calculate and interpret period-over-period changes and rolling averages.
  - Identify trends and patterns hidden in the data.

### Step 3: Utilizing Decomposition Trees

- **Objective**: Identify variables with significant influence on target outcomes.
- **Activities**:
  - Learn how to construct and interpret Decomposition Trees in Power BI.
  - Use Decomposition Trees to break down and explain target outcomes by other influencing variables.

### Step 4: Exploring Key Influencers

- **Objective**: Understand the impact of specific variables and segments on target outcomes.
- **Activities**:
  - Build and interpret the Key Influencers visual tool in Power BI.
  - Analyze how changes in specific variables and segments affect the target outcome.

## Dataset and Tools

- **Dataset**: Time series data relevant to the analysis (e.g., sales, user engagement, etc.).
- **Tools**: Power BI, Decomposition Trees, Key Influencers visual.

## Key Insights

1. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - Identified key metrics and trends using line charts and rolling averages.
   - Uncovered period-over-period changes and seasonal patterns.

2. **Decomposition Trees**:
   - Pinpointed which variables significantly influence target outcomes.
   - Provided a detailed breakdown of factors affecting the primary metrics.

3. **Key Influencers**:
   - Determined how specific variables and segments impact target outcomes.
   - Enabled a deeper understanding of the drivers behind changes in metrics.

## Conclusion

The project effectively utilized Power BIâ€™s advanced visualization tools to analyze time series data, uncover trends, and identify key influencers. The insights gained from this analysis provide a robust foundation for making informed decisions based on temporal patterns and influential factors.
